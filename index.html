      <p> The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python. It’s capable of doing everything you’d expect a desktop computer to do, from browsing the internet and playing high-definition video, to making spreadsheets, word-processing, and playing games.
      </p>
      <p>
What’s more, the Raspberry Pi  has the ability to interact with the outside world, and has been used in a wide array of digital maker projects, from music machines and parent detectors to weather stations and tweeting birdhouses with infra-red cameras. We want to see the Raspberry Pi being used by kids all over the world to learn to program and understand how computers work.</p>

      <p> The Raspeberry Pi is a very small single board computer. Outfitted with all the ports you need that comes with a regular computer. </p>

      <p><strong> Essentials </strong></p>
      <p><strong> SD card -</strong><br>
We recommend a minimum of 8GB class 4 or class 10 microSD card. To save time, you can get a card that is pre-installed with NOOBS or Raspberry Pi OS, although setting up your own card is easy.
       <br>
       <strong>Display and connectivity cable - </strong><br>
       
Any HDMI/DVI monitor or TV should work as a display for the Pi. For best results, use a display with HDMI input; other types of connection for older devices are also available.<br>
       <strong>Keyboard and mouse -</strong><br>
Any standard USB keyboard and mouse will work with your Raspberry Pi.
Wireless keyboards and mice will work if already paired.
For keyboard layout configuration options see raspi-config.<br>
       <strong>Power supply</strong> - <br>
The Pi is powered by a USB Micro [models pre 4B] or USB Type-C [model 4B] power supply (like most standard mobile phone chargers).
You need a good-quality power supply that can supply at least 3A at 5V for the Model 4B, 2A at 5V for the Model 3B and 3B+, or 700mA at 5V for the earlier, lower-powered Pi models. We recommend using the official Raspberry Pi power supply, which is designed specifically for Raspberry Pi.
Low-current (~700mA) power supplies will work for basic usage, but are likely to cause the Pi to reboot if it draws too much power. They are not suitable for use with the Pi 3 or 4.</p>
      <h4> Installing The OS</h4>
      <p> Raspberry Pi have developed a graphical SD card writing tool that works on Mac OS, Ubuntu 18.04 and Windows, and is the easiest option for most users as it will download the image and install it automatically to the SD card.
<br><br>
Download the latest version of Raspberry Pi Imager and install it.
If you want to use Raspberry Pi Imager on the Raspberry Pi itself, you can install it from a terminal using sudo apt install rpi-imager.
Connect an SD card reader with the SD card inside.
Open Raspberry Pi Imager and choose the required OS from the list presented.
Choose the SD card you wish to write your image to.
Review your selections and click 'WRITE' to begin writing data to the SD card.
Note: if using the Raspberry Pi Imager on Windows 10 with Controlled Folder Access enabled, you will need to explicitly allow the Raspberry Pi Imager permission to write the SD card. If this is not done, Raspberry Pi Imager will fail with a "failed to write" error.

Using other tools

Most other tools require you to download the image first, then use the tool to write it to your SD card.
<br><br>
Download the image
<br><br>
Official images for recommended operating systems are available to download from the Raspberry Pi website downloads page.
<br><br>
Alternative distributions are available from third-party vendors.
<br><br>
You may need to unzip .zip downloads to get the image file (.img) to write to your SD card.
<br><br>
Note: the Raspberry Pi OS with desktop image contained in the ZIP archive is over 4GB in size and uses the ZIP64 format. To uncompress the archive, a unzip tool that supports ZIP64 is required. The following zip tools support ZIP64:
<br><br>
7-Zip (Windows)
The Unarchiver (Mac)
Unzip (Linux)
Writing the image
<br><br>
How you write the image to the SD card will depend on the operating system you are using.
<br><br>
Linux<br>
Mac OS<br>
Windows<br>
Chrome OS<br>
Boot your new OS
<br><br>
You can now insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi and power it up.
<br><br>
For the official Raspberry Pi OS, if you need to manually log in, the default user name is pi, with password raspberry. Remember the default keyboard layout is set to UK.
<br><br>
You should change the default password straight away to ensure your Raspberry Pi is secure.

      <p> When you boot up your raspberry pi you will already have a programming IDE available to you, "Python". Python is one of the most in demand skills at the moment because of it's easy use and functionaility.</p>
      <h4> Our First Program </h4>
      <p> Open up your python IDE and we type in this code:</p>
      <code>print("Hello World")</code>
      <br>
      <p> "print" is when printing text to the console. Every language does it differently and this is just pythons way.  </p>

      <p> Besides all the cool programming you can do with the raspberry pi you can also bring those programming skills to the real world. With the right cables you can make insane projects with your raspberry pi ranging from just a simple file server to a weather station.</P>
     <h4> LED Project</h4>
     <p> Here is a simple project to ease you into the capability of the raspberry pi. We are going to use the Raspberry pi, a breadboard, a f to m wire, a m to m wire, a 330 resistor, and a LED light.</p>
     <br>
     <p>Place an LED in your breadboard so that the legs are either side of the middle ‘trench’. the breadboard is not connected across this gap.</p>
     <img src="https://projects-static.raspberrypi.org/projects/leds-buzzers-scratch-games/28c825dab1740fed7c57009486925b5767804231/en/images/lightLED_ledInBb.png">
     <br>
     <p>Insert one end of 330Ω resistor in the same line of connected holes as the longer-legged anode of the LED.
<br>
       Place the other end of the resistor into a convenient place somewhere else on the breadboard.</p>
     <img src="https://projects-static.raspberrypi.org/projects/leds-buzzers-scratch-games/28c825dab1740fed7c57009486925b5767804231/en/images/lightLED_ledAndResistor.png">
     <br>
     <p>Take a male to female jumper cable (has a pin on one end and a socket hole on the other) and connect the pin into the breadboard so that it connects to the second resistor leg as shown below.
<br>
       Connect the female (socket) end to one of the Raspberry Pi’s 3.3v GPIO pins.</p>
     <img src="https://projects-static.raspberrypi.org/projects/leds-buzzers-scratch-games/28c825dab1740fed7c57009486925b5767804231/en/images/lightLED_ledResistorAndWire1.png">
     <br>
     <p>Lastly, add another male to female jumper cable, connecting the male end to the shorter-legged cathode and the female end to one fo the Raspberry Pi’s ground (GND, - or -ve) pins</p>
     <img src="https://projects-static.raspberrypi.org/projects/leds-buzzers-scratch-games/28c825dab1740fed7c57009486925b5767804231/en/images/lightLED_ledResistorAndWires.png">
     <p> Let There Be Light! </p>

        <p> The amount of projects for all ages you can do on your raspberry pi is amazing. You can be creating your network server/game server to creating a remote control car with your kids. It does really help kids with programming and physical computing which is why they are so cheap and schools can buy them for there students.</p>
